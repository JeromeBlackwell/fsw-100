        <p>There’s no sugarcoating it; India is a big, beautiful beast. The world’s second most populous country will overwhelm you with cinematic wonder one moment, diesel and dust the next. That’s the best part of a visit to the subcontinent: India is never boring. Sensational displays of color and culture abound, from majestic temples and monuments and intricate cuisines to never-ending festivals, soaring mountains and far-flung beaches — and those are just the obvious highlights.</p>
