                               <p><b>In cases of inclement weather, the captain reserves the right to cancel any trip. Safety is our #1 priority.  If the forecast is calling for severe weather, high winds or a small craft warning, there will likely be a cancellation. The captain will inform you as soon as possible of any chances for a cancelled charter. If your trip is cancelled due to inclement weather or mechanical issues, we will simply reschedule for a future day that season. We do not refund deposits for bad weather.</b></p>
